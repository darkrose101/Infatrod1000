# Infatrod1000

What the project does in a nutshell is Testing the Robustness of a Firewall (if you got it remotely), launch python malware scripts
such as ransomware, adware etc. But it is designed for aspiring cyber security progenys, who enjoy a little bit of trouble, and also 
who like playing hero by saving the day (deciphering the files)

The one thing i'd advice is that: 1) Store the script on usr/local/bin/ (LINUX) and c:\windows\system32\ (WINDOWS), so that it can run from anywhere
                                  2) Don't provide a path to run the script on core directories like the ones mentioned above. It will CRIPPLE your PC

Also as an open-source project, feel free to download and add on to it and try it out. In case of any queries about the main script, let me know

                                                   [[ HAPPY SCRIPTING ]]
